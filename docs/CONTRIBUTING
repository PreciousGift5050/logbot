the very high level install steps for a development setup are:
- clone repo
- copy etc/_sample.yml to etc/_development.yml
- edit etc/_development.yml and set all the values as required
- install cpanm and the local::lib perl library at a system level
- install sass and uglifyjs
- run `cpanm --verbose --local-lib ~/perl5/ --notest --installdeps . --with-develop`
- run `./dev-server` to start the web server
- run `./logbot-irc development` to start the irc server
- run `./logbot-consumer development` to start the message->database consumer

`dev-server` will automatically run `make` when web resources are updated.
if `dev-server` is not running you must run `make` manually.  some changes
require a full rebuild of the resources with `make -B`.

run `dev-tidy` before creating any pull requests; this will auto-format
perl and sass.
