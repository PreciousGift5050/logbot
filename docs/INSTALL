this document is under construction.

the very high level install steps for a production deployment are:
- install cpanm and the local::lib perl library at a system level
- create a user specifically for logbot
- clone repo
- run `cpanm --verbose --local-lib ~/perl5/ --notest --installdeps .`
- copy etc/_sample.yml to etc/network.yml (eg. etc/mozilla.yml)
- edit etc/network.yml and set all the values as required
- run logbot-irc and logbot-consumer as daemons (eg. using systemd)
- run logbot-nightly and logbot-backup nightly (eg. using cron)
- figure out how you're going to run the mojolicous logbot-web app
  - http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook#DEPLOYMENT
  - i'm using:
    - logbot-hypnotoad under systemd (hypnotoad wrapper around logbot-web)
    - apache-httpd with reverse proxy hitting logbot-hypnotoad
    - the docs/ directory contains my systemd and apache-httpd confs
